# Yet another mtcars example (analysing data using R)

In this short example, we're going to use R _code cells_ and a _range input_ to create an interactive plot of the famous (infamous?) [_mtcars_](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html "undefined") data set as described in the R help:

> The data was extracted from the 1974
>
> _Motor Trend_
>
>  US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The [`mtcars.source`](mtcars.source) directory includes a Markdown file with the text of the analysis and some code samples. As it is Markdown, you cannot execute these bits of code. However,
you can open this file in Stencila which will allow you to interact with the code.

Currently Stencila Desktop allows you to directly open only Dar (Reproducible Document Archive) format. You can use [`Stencila converter`](https://github.com/stencila/convert)
in order to convert files from other popular formats (`md`, `Rmd`, `ipynb`, `tex`, `odt`, `html`, `docx`) into `dar`.

We already did this step for you, so if you don't want to deal with the conversion step, you can just download the [`examples`](https://github.com/stencila/examples/archive/master.zip) and open `mtcars.dar` folder in Stencila Desktop.
