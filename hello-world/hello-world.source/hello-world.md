# Hello world

A very simple Markdown document with one code cell in Mini:

```mini
'Hello world, this is Mini!'
```

and another code cell in JavaScript which tells us the current time. Try changing the code in the cell.

```js
//!
return `Hello world, this is Javascript and it is ${new Date()}!`
```
