# Simple example of different formats in Stencila

This is a simple 'Hello world' example repeated using alternative formats:

- [`.html` with Mini and JavaScript](hello-world.source/hello-world.html) in HTML;
- [`.md` with Mini and JavaScript](hello-world.source/hello-world.md) in plain Markdown;
- [`.Rmd` with R](hello-world.source/hello-world.Rmd) in RMarkdown;
- [`.ipynb` with Python](hello-world.source/hello-world.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

Currently Stencila Desktop allows you to directly open only Dar (Reproducible Document Archive) format. You can use [`Stencila converter`](https://github.com/stencila/convert)
in order to convert files from other popular formats (`md`, `Rmd`, `ipynb`, `tex`, `odt`, `html`, `docx`) into `dar`.

We already did this step for you, so if you don't want to deal with the conversion step, you can just download the [`examples`](https://github.com/stencila/examples/archive/master.zip) and open `hello-world.dar` folder in Stencila Desktop.
